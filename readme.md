# Cynthia Mugo - Full Stack Developer Portfolio
#### 
**By Cynthia Mugo**| Jun 1, 2025
## Description
This is a personal portfolio website designed to present my work as a full-stack developer. It showcases my current projects, technical skills, and a little about who I am. As I continue learning and building, I will update the site with new frameworks, languages, and improved features.

The layout is responsive and minimalist, making it clean and easy to navigate across devices. This site was built with HTML, CSS, and beginner-friendly tools, and will expand as my experience grows.

## Features

- Home section with a short introduction
